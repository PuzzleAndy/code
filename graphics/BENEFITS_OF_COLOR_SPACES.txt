RGB - Available everywhere. Easy to memorize the coordinates for simple colors like green.

Oklab - Better linear gradients. Conversion to black and white.

HSB - Makes it easy to generate tints and shades from a fixed hue and saturation.

HSV - Necessary for many algorithms.

XYZ - Necessary to convert to CIELAB.

CIELAB - Color distance formulas.

YUV - Very fast luminance computation for converting color images to grayscale. Not as good as CIELAB but much much faster.
